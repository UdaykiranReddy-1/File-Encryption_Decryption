# File-Encryption_Decryption

This is a basic C code using 3-4 of it's built in header files , for file encryption and decryption . 

For those who don't know what **File Encryption and Decryption** mean , it is nothing but converting the content of a file(plaintext) to ciphertext which is non-readable and not-understable by a human/middle-person until it is decrypted back.

This *Encryption and Decryption* at the basic level is done by using a random key for encypting and decrypting both. And I have used the same concept in my project but not very direct . Refer to code to understand it's working in depth.

## To Run this program , you will have to :
1) Run the C file in any environment you like , with the file to be encrypted or decrypted in the same directory.
2) Follow the commands as led by by the program further .

*Don't forget to Remember the **key** with which you encrypted the file(which will be prompted in the terminal during the process) , because you will need the same to decrypt . The use of other keys needs to be strictly avoided as it will not decrypt your files and Hence leads to data loss (As you have altered the ciphertext to be decypted by a specific key with a different key , Hence because of which in future you won't be able to get back your data even though you get the key for the same)...*
